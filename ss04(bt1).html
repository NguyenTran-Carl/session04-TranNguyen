        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

    <div id="with">
        With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between element, how elements are
        positioned and laid out , what background images or background colors are to be used , different displays for
        different devices and screen sizes , and much more!
    </div><br>
    <div id="tip">
        <b>Tip :</b> The word <b>cascading </b>means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all
        children elements
        within the parent . So , if you set the color of the body text to " blue " , all headings , paragraphs , and
        other text elements within the body will also get the same color ( unless you specify something else ) !
